# Time Series Forecasting of COVID-19 Statistics with Neural Nets
Demonstrates and compares several neural network models for time series forecasting.  
## Structure
Model definitions and creation is in ```models.ipynb```  
A report on the effectiveness of each model is under ```report/report.pdf```
Full Model Comparisons for stacked & simple LSTM and CNN is in ```Neural Network comparison using state-level data.ipynb```
